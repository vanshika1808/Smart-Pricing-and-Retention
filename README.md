# Smart-Pricing-and-Retention
Combined Machine Learning solutions for Airbnb Price Prediction and Telecom Customer Churn Prediction.
## Project 1: Airbnb Price Prediction  

**Objective:**  
Estimate Airbnb property listing prices based on location, property details, and host attributes.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Cleaned and prepared Airbnb dataset, handled missing values, and engineered new features.  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study price distributions and feature relationships.  
- Applied regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) for price prediction.  
- Evaluated model with RÂ² and RMSE to measure accuracy.  

**Results:**  
- Model provided reliable predictions of listing prices.  
- Location, room type, and number of reviews emerged as the most important predictors.
## Project 2: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction  

**Objective:**  
Identify customers likely to leave a telecom service provider using classification models.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Conducted data preprocessing, feature selection, and handled class imbalance.  
- Explored patterns of churn through descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
- Trained multiple classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.  
- Measured performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  

**Results:**  
- Built a classification model capable of predicting churn with strong accuracy.  
- Provided insights into key churn drivers such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.
- Extended the model to make predictions on new incoming customer data, showing how it can be applied in real business scenarios.
